# DC_Motor_Control
C++ program and simulation on a DC motor's performance by calculating torque, speed, and back EMF dynamics. Users can input motor constants, apply PWM control, and observe speed variations under different voltages and load torques. It integrates power electronics with control concepts, providing hands-on understanding of real-world motor behavior.
